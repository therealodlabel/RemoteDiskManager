The Remote Disk Manager

A simplified app for help desk usage who have admin access and would like a streamlined program that performs a specialized task.

The app will perform these actions.
1. Connect to a domain attached windows PC and give the current remaining capacity of the C: drive.
2. List all users in the c:\user folder and allow the admin to select and delete the user profile folder.

This is only really useful to helpdesk IT who have to perform the following functions.
1. Delete corrupt/unused profiles from PC's
2. Have a real time value present of the current space on the PC

This tool is for a very limited range of scenarios that may happen for a regular IT professional.
